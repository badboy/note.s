note.s
======

note.s is a simple notes app that can sync all your notes with Dropbox.

Status
======

Far from done. Basic things are working (note.s can be loaded, saved and deleted) but it's unstable.
If you want to help, fill bug reports, add comments, tell me about improvements or just hack the code.

How to use
==========

Load it as an unpacked extension in chrome.

You should see it on your dashboard ([chrome://newtab](chrome://newtab)), without an icon yet (help me with that).

On first start note.s should ask you for permission to connect to dropbox. If not, fix the code :P

Misc
====

Thanks to [kenotron](https://github.com/kenotron/) for the awesome [sourcekit](https://github.com/kenotron/sourcekit) editor extension.
Thanks to [antimatter15](https://github.com/antimatter15) for his small but fancy chrome extensions, which helped me to understand the extension API.

Someone I forgot or someone just want to be mentioned here? Let me know, give me a reason and I add your name (;

How to contribute
=================

Want to help?

You got several options:

If you just want to hack code: Fork it, make your changes and let me know (send me a pull request).

If you can't code or don't want to: open issues with bugs or improvement suggestions. I will find some time to get it done.

If you're an designer or just creative, do me a favour by creating a nice little icon for this extension.
